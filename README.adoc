These are my solutions to the https://adventofcode.com/2021[Advent of Code 2021] problems.  I make no guarantees of code quality or anything else.  In fact at least one of them doesnʼt even solve the problem in the general case, just for my particular input.

= Notes
Because Advent of Code is largely scored based on time, even though I usually wasnʼt trying very hard to be fast, a lot of this is faster/lower quality than I usually do.  Once I submitted a solution I tried to avoid changing the relevant file, although I probably did occasionally by mistake.
