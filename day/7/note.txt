The value 488 as hardcoded into part 2 works with the puzzle input here.  It obviously doessnʼt work in the general case.  I could try looking on either side of the real-valued mean, but Iʼm not sure that would actually quite work; I could give up on closed-form solutions and code somethnig to find the minimum anyway, which wouldnʼt be that hard but I disprefer it.  After writing this note Iʼll probably do *something* for partb-general.py, but I havenʼt written that yet.
